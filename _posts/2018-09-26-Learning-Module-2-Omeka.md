I decided to try learning Omeka Classic instead of the MiniComp Wax workflow to build an online exhibit. I was really disappointed with Omeka.net and wanted to learn something new by an up-and-coming digital humanities scholar, Alex Gil, creator of Wax. Although, I will continue to use Jekyll for my ePortfolio, I think perhaps going with a more established platform like Omeka Classic would be more safe. Omeka has more established support, documentation and a larger 'community of practice' that I can approach for help.
