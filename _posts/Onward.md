So, ReclaimHosting is incredible. It is a cheap way to purchase hosting space and my own domain. I bought the student plan for $30 a year and it comes with 2GB of storage, which might fill up fast if I am uploading high resolution images. However, they make it seem like it is really easy to upgrade and buy more space, so I am feeling pretty confident about my choice. I am happy to say that I finally have my first domain!

ReclaimHosting also allows you to “add applications” to your site. I am not sure if I completely understand how they integrate Omeka.org into my site. In fact, if anyone knows I would love an explanation. All I know so far, is that on my control panel for my hosting account, there is an Omeka.org icon and my CMS appears. There are also applications for Wordpress and Scalar. I feel like I got a good deal. My mom would be proud.

So, onward to the problem!

I decided to use VRA Core(Visual Resources Association) as my metadata schema for the digital collection I am building via Omeka. VRA Core is “a data standard for the descriptions of images and work of art and culture”. What a slogan! This schema is ideal for my collection since I am describing works of art depicting scenes from the [Aeneid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid). You’re welcome.

There is an option in Omeka to batch upload metadata records from a CSV. In the past, I had been able to easily match column headings of my unstructured data to the structured Dublin Core element. It was very easy to upload thousands of items. I was excited to use VRA Core also because there was a plugin for it that is not available through the freer, simpler Omeka.net. Unfortunately, it does not map to subelements. These subelements like artist role, earliest date, latest date, technique and style period contain information that I am particularly interested in analyzing. Since the batch upload of my data would not be able to be mapped to subelements, the alternative is reorganizing my data so that I can individually add each record. Out of 1,000. Yes, I am attempting to add 1,000 entries manually within three weeks.

I communicated with an online community of practice when I hit this wall. I had posted a question about it in a subforum of Omeka.org, but no one responded after a week and the subforum definitely is full of cobwebs. So, after engaging with my in person, IRL community of practice, I decided to post a few other places. The Digital Humanities Co-Working sessions consist of us 5 grad students from different humanities departments and UT’s Digital Scholarship librarian, Allyssa Guzman. There, we spend some time presenting our projects and where we are with them, successes and frustrations. We offer each other feedback and advice- I really enjoy these meetups. I learn something new every time I go and it is a community I feel comfortable discussing my ups and downs with when it comes to digital humanities. 

The wider DH community can be pretty intimidating to me, having been to a couple of conferences/workshops, reading the journals, and even reading what others in DH are doing on twitter. There are definitely some DH celebrities. Everyone is very open about sharing their knowledge but sometimes it feels impossible to know everything. Which, is kind of an impossible goal in the first when it comes to DH. There are so many subfields but if I am to become a digital scholarship librarian like I want, I feel like I must know all the tools!

Anyway, onward. A couple of guys from the coworking group recommended a different Omeka board and the more or less official, THE Digital Humanities Slack. I received an answer from someone at Omeka within the hour, but I never received a response from the Slack. I was surprised. On the Slack channel, there seems to be a quicker rate of responses for other threads and everyone responds. Ouch!

Basically, I found out that there is no way to batch upload. More on the Great Depression next journal entry. But, thanks either way for the help communities of practice!
