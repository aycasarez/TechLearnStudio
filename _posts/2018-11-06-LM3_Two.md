Today is the day I actually start the zine. I made a list of things I would be interested in exploring in my zine and boy, are they all over the place. There seems to be a popularity of zine themes like fanzines, politics, poetry and art. My list is a mix of topics and it is hard to nail down a theme. As I have been telling friends/strangers about making a zine, the first question is always "What's the theme? What is it about?"

Cue my deer in the headlights look and panicked response of "Well...I have a lot of ideas...". 

So, given my topics ranging from music obsessions, rants and raves, my dog's editorial section and collages, I have decided to make the theme into a I guess what would be described as a "personal journal". 

So let's talk about the layout and how this will look. I consulted the forum for my online community of practice, [We Make Zines](http://wemakezines.com/). There was one interesting post that some posed on how people usually layout and create their zines:

Given zine's history of being compiled in a more analog style, I was a little surprised to see so many discussions of desktop publishing. I guess I shouldn't be surprised and in fact it seems like a great way to get zine creators from the digital age to participate. As neat as these digital options like Scribus and Photoshop seem, I really want to get more hands on. So, I checked out the [Stolen Sharpie Revolution](https://www.amazon.com/Stolen-Sharpie-Revolution-Zine-Resource/dp/0972696725) and [Whatcha mean, whatâ€™s a zine? : the art of making zines and minicomics](https://catalog.lib.utexas.edu/record=b6488340~S29) from the library. 

These resources have helped a lot on getting an idea of what the entire zine process looks like. I also checked out [Fanzines: the DIY Revolution](https://catalog.lib.utexas.edu/record=b8066667~S29) to get an idea about the history of diy culture and fanzines. I learned that Joanna Russ, famed 70s New Wave science fiction author, wrote articles for and created Star Trek fanzines. It's pretty cool to see a range of people from respected academics like Russ to diy icons like Kathleen Hanna create these underground ephemora. 

Anyway, back to layout and creation I have settled on this layout for my zine:

Excuse the chicken scratch, but writing out the layout was easier for me and easier for me to understand how to collate pages through the copier to compile the damn thing. 

So I have my layout now and I brought a variety of books and old magazines that I have been dog earring to copy and collage into my zine. One of my favorites is this strange and sensationalistic book I found a year ago in the stacks called, Magic and the Supernatural. There's an engraving of Baphomet on the cover and it contains many laughably uncitable records of the supernatural and occult. Perhaps I am especially fascinated as a lapsed Catholic, but I find some of the imagery in the book especially strange and humorous.

So here is my dilemma, as a financially unstable grad student, how to do I find a place to copy these strange things for free and without fear of reprecussions from using the work or school copier? Turns out there is no good answer! I used the iSchool admin copier to copy pages from the Magic and Supernatural book as well as surprisingly sexually suggestive advertisements from a 1980s Home and Garden. Of course, as I was using it, Philip Doty walked in as well as three other faculty to collect their print jobs. In my panic to copy and get out as fast as I could, I definitely accidentally left a weird page on the copier and will no longer be making eye contact with any member of the iSchool faculty. 

It took me a while to get over that slight humiliation but now that I have my copies, I have been happily cutting, pasting, writing, arranging and rearranging. Even if it does not seem like much progress at this point, I think it is important to reflect on the fact that I got over two of my most intimadating hurdles:

1. learning how to get started by thinking seriously about what was holding me back 
2. experimenting with the copier even through all the discomfort

I am looking forward to sitting on my living room floor and getting to work in the actual creation process.
