Not that the other two modules of this course haven't been exciting learning ventures but this hands on learning module has been an especially fun and creative outlet for deaing with the stressful last semester of the iSchool program.

For the past couple of weeks, I have been cutting and pasting and creating my zine on my living room floor with my dog and boyfriend. It has been a comforting space and yet also insular space to create my zine. I needed to interact with an offline community of practice. I had volunteered and patronized the [Lone Star Zine Fest](http://www.lonestarzinefest.org/) in September before I thought of a zine as my learning module. I looked for similar kinds of events in November but only found one in Houston that I could not attend during the Thanksgiving holidays.

Luckily, I met a friend of a friend one night, told them I was making my first zine and he recommended I come out to [RotFest](https://www.facebook.com/events/1899658126748307/), a dingy, low brow event showcasing local artists and their work. The event advertised zines, art and general weirdness that definitely spoke to me. 

Unlike the other two communities of practice I have focused on for this course, I only knew one other person at the community event. Most attendees were local artists/vendors and patrons. As much as I wanted to learn from more established makers, it was intimidating to admit my novice stage in zine making to anyone. Luckily, there was a zine making station much like the one I had seen at the Lone Star Zine Fest in September. I was very interested in learning about the zine creation process from the more established makers there and hearing their advice for someone who was just starting to share their art with friends and family.

I am happy to have met Whitney, also know as [@sewerbabe](http://sewerbabe.com/), one of the people running the zine making table where old magazines, markers, pens, paste, tape and paper were running amuck. I had bought one of her zines earlier, "The Street Rat's Guide to Making and Printing Comix!".

I told her that I was creating my first zine and how I found it in some ways more of a structured process (layout, copying, compiling) than I had expected. And yet also more unstructured than I was used to (creativity and exploration of the unknown or the strange encouraged, perfectionism and overthinking discouraged). 

We discussed the difficulty of operating within a creative process like making a zine where both structure and the lack of it are encouraged. I described my anxiety making copies of strange images with the faculty copier. She laughed and told me she had experienced the same growing up in a religious household, creating fanzines using the church copier while she was out of her mother's sight.

Like my experiences with other communities of practice, I experienced the greatest validation hearing similar frustrations or experiences from others. She also stressed how difficult it was for her to get started and especially when getting started meant sharing her work with others. Although our discussion was reminiscent of some of the zine creation commentary I had read in resources like [Whatcha mean, whatâ€™s a zine? : the art of making zines and minicomics](https://catalog.lib.utexas.edu/record=b6488340~S29), having these kind of in person discussions somehow makes these creative enterprises more *real*:

Whitney emphasized her support system of other zine creators, friends and her partner. I asked what she thought about their level of objectivity when they read her zines. I have seen some zines that look sloppily put together, aesthetically unpleasing and was afraid of someone having the same opinion when receiving my zine and then maybe lying to me about it. 

While perhaps side stepping the question, she reiterated what I have I read in other zine resources: Your first zine isn't going to be great. It isn't going to going to be what you thought **but your next one will be better.**

When I asked the event organizer, Eric a similar question about sharing their comics and growth as an artist, he pulled out a print of Limp Bizkit he drew of when he was 13. He told me he was surprised at its popularity at this particular event. When he created it at 13 it was for fun and for some reason people are excited about it now and want to buy it. When he created it, it wasn't for anyone else. Perhaps being in an academic environment for so long has forced me into a line of thinking that there has to be an end goal for producing anything. Is it for school? Will it earn me the respect of my colleagues? Will it go on my resume? 

Creating this zine will not satisfy any of those questions with a postive answer. Except perhaps for the school portion...but I do want this to be an authentic learning experience that I can continue on after. To do this successfully, I need to continue to find inspiration in other zines that I admire, grow outside of my comfort zone by acknowledging my current novice level (I see you, [Dreyfus bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition)). I still may be in a state of "non-situational, decomposed, analytical monitoring" but my next zine will be better because I will have learned from myself and others.
